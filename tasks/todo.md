## Done
- [x] `6a265aaf` — "Görev Tipi" column in Görevlerim grid (matched Personelimin Görevleri). Pushed.
- [x] `6a265b44` — Gittiği Yer destination pills uniform green (was tinted by approval status). Pushed. Moved to Done.
- [x] `6a265c3e` — Creator can cancel own job (CancelJobCommand isCreator) + cascade non-terminal tasks to Cancelled; İptal button in Taleplerim. Pushed. Moved to Done.
- [x] `6a265d9b` — Auto-approved create now assigns JobNumber (was "Onay Bekleyen" in approved list); İade hidden for manager's own InternalUnit in Taleplerim. Pushed. Moved to Done.
- [x] `6a265ea9` — Manager Birim Dışı number fix: SAME root cause as 6a265d9b, resolved by that commit (JobNumber assigned at creation for all !requiresOwnerApproval). No new code. Moved to Done.
- [x] `6a266007` — Shared DueDatePill (yellow=last day, red=overdue) in Jobs/Tasks/IncomingRequests Son Tarih columns; CSS in globals.css. Pushed. Moved to Done.
- [x] `6a26624e` — Shared DateCell (calendar icon + date) on all date columns in Jobs/Tasks/IncomingRequests grids. Pushed. Moved to Done.
- [x] `6a26631b` — Onay/Tamamlanma/İptal-İade date columns → FilterableTh (sort+filter) in Jobs/Tasks/IncomingRequests; flattened ownerDecidedAtUtc for sort. Pushed. Moved to Done.
- [x] `6a2665f4` — 401 in ensureOk → clearAuthSession + SESSION_EXPIRED_EVENT → drop to login; AuthContext storage listener auto-logs-out other tabs. Pushed. Moved to Done.
- [x] `6a26673e` — İade shown only for managers (non-internal); standard user gets İptal only. Pushed. Moved to Done.
- [x] `6a2669a1` — Dashboard: added outgoingInProgressCount box after outgoing-pending (BE GetDashboardQuery + contract + FE type + i18n); pending tightened to approval-only. Pushed. Moved to Done.
- [x] `6a266a85` — Dashboard chart section md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 (was lg:grid-cols-2). Pushed. Moved to Done.
- [x] `6a266b79` — Removed pending-approval scope from /jobs (chips + default→department-pool); ?scope=pending-approval redirects to /incoming-requests. Pushed. Moved to Done.
- [x] `6a266bd3` — Renamed dashboard label → "Birime Gelen Onay Bekleyen Talepler" (tr/en) + repointed link to /incoming-requests. Pushed. Moved to Done.
- [x] `6a2687a6` — Removed active-department filter from "mine" scope in JobQueries so multi-dept user sees all own requests in Taleplerim. Pushed. Moved to Done.

- [x] `6a26885e` — Internal owner dropdown lists all active dept staff (incl. self) for managers; non-managers keep pool+self. Pushed. Moved to Done.

## Done (round 2 — new cards)
- [x] `6a27ba60` — After create, navigate(-1) to previous page instead of fixed list/dashboard; kind switches use replace. Pushed. Moved to Done.
- [x] `6a27bb7c` — Removed İade Et button entirely from Taleplerim (creator can only İptal) + deleted dead return modal. SUPERSEDES card 10. Pushed. Moved to Done.
- [x] `6a265d9b` (reopened) — Görevlerim button: İptal/İade + return choice only for ExternalUnit tasks; internal/routine → İptal-only (drives label + skipChoose by jobRequestType, not role). Pushed. Moved to Done.
