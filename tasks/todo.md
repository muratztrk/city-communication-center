- [x] `6a286269` (reopened) — DateTimePicker forceDown prop; filter calendars always open downward. Pushed. Moved to Done.
- [x] `6a2869ac` — Moved Taleplerim/Görevlerim search+date back to chip nav (out of banner); narrowed search width 9rem→6rem. Pushed. Moved to Done.
- [x] `6a28639b` (reopened) — Force official logo on login (was overridden by tenant appearance.logoUrl); always uses tire-belediyesi-logo.png. Pushed. Moved to Done.

- [x] `6a285de9` — Fixed: opening another tab no longer logs out. Cross-tab logout now via dedicated LOGOUT_BROADCAST_KEY (real logout only), not storage churn. Reconciles 6a2665f4. Pushed. Moved to Done.

- [x] `6a285240` — Centered İşlemler action buttons in Birime Gelen Talepler (flex justify-center). Pushed. Moved to Done.
- [x] `6a280f01` — Wallboard: merged "Görevin Talep Yeri" + "Talebi Oluşturan" into "Görevin Talep Yeri/Oluşturan" (dept top, creator below). Pushed. Moved to Done.

## Round 8 (new cards, Jun 10)
- [x] `ykH6nKxa` — Banner date filter text was unreadable: empty-state muted-foreground Tailwind utility (utilities layer) overrode banner white (components layer); forced `.sticky-page-header .scope-chip-date .field-input` color `!important` to match "Ara". Pushed. Moved to Done.
- [ ] `fuMAFjia` — Login: center only "Tire İletişim Merkezi" title in green hero.
- [x] `YlC2hK7H` — Wallboard: removed Talep No (jobNumber) column header + cell. Pushed. Moved to Done.
- [x] `pcK6CiqA` — MultiSelectDropdown: added green "Seç" button (bottom-right footer) that closes the dropdown; applies to manager owner picker. Pushed. Moved to Done.
- [x] `z9PpTlId` — Dept Tasks: added "Görev Tipi" column (header+cell now include isDepartmentTasksView, after Başlık). Pushed. Moved to Done.
- [x] `Zm3d6Xu9` — Banner search now scans all columns (number/priority/dates/dept/creator/status/type), not just Başlık, in Jobs/Tasks/Incoming. Incoming reuses extracted getColumnValue accessor. Wallboard has no banner search. Pushed. Moved to Done.
- [x] `uuyCK0cw` — Wallboard default order now createdAtUtc desc (newest first) as primary sort; priority/due-date demoted to tiebreakers. Column-header sort still overrides. Pushed. Moved to Done.
- [x] `4nERM5Az` — Wallboard stats now 4 clickable filter buttons (Toplam Bekleyen/Birim İçi/Birim Dışı/Son Tarihi Geçmiş Görevler), hover+pointer, active highlight, default 'total'; filters the list. Added overdue count + wallboard.overdue i18n (tr/en). Pushed. Moved to Done.
- [x] `ydzQ2PI7` — Internal request "Gittiği Yer" now shows owner dept + assigned staff name below. Added optional AssignedUserDisplayName to JobSummaryResponse (populated in JobQueries list from job tasks' AssignedUserId), FE type + renderOutgoingDestination. Pushed. Moved to Done.
- [x] `zKMGZt6C` — Birime Gelen: renamed "Oluşturan" → "Talep Yeri/Oluşturan" (new i18n key tr/en); cell now shows departmentName (top) + creator (below). Pushed. Moved to Done.

## Round 9 (cards arriving during round 8)
- [x] `pcK6CiqA` (reopened) — MultiSelectDropdown now flex-col with max-h-72; only the options list scrolls (flex-1 overflow-y-auto), "Seç" footer pinned at bottom (shrink-0). Pushed. Moved to Done.
- [x] `lUimEurb` — Üst Düzey Yönetici = Reporter role. Reporter landing on /requests/new auto-redirects to ?kind=external (skips type selection); external form title/desc swapped to neutral "Talep Oluştur" wording (reporterFormTitle/Description i18n tr+en) so "Birim Dışı" is hidden for them. Pushed. Moved to Done.

- [x] `Zm3d6Xu9` (reopened) — Banner search now covers date columns too: Jobs added owner-decided/completed/updated dates, Tasks added completed/updated dates (Incoming already had all). Same formatDateTime as displayed cells. Pushed. Moved to Done.

- [x] `4nERM5Az` (reopened) — Wallboard stat buttons: changed yellow (#fef08a) numbers + active border/tint to priority orange #f97316 (text-orange-500, same as Görev No priority text). Confirmed via card image. Pushed. Moved to Done.

## STATUS: Round 9 complete — Doing list drained.

## Round 10 (cards arriving during round 9 polling)
- [x] `XLzwexhd` — MultiSelectDropdown: added red "Çıkış" button left of "Seç"; both close the dropdown (Çıkış = exit without picking). Pushed. Moved to Done.
- [x] `Zm3d6Xu9` (reopened #2) — Added missing 'departmentName' (Talep Yeri) to Birime Gelen SEARCH_COLUMN_KEYS so request-location is searchable. Jobs/Tasks/Incoming already cover number/title/status/priority/dept/creator/type + all date columns. Pushed. Moved to Done.
- [x] `mr3mhNbq` — Login hero: increased section vertical padding (lg:py-6→py-10, 2xl:py-9→py-14) for more top/bottom spacing per arrows. Pushed. Moved to Done.
- [x] `4nERM5Az` (reopened #2) — Lightened wallboard stat numbers + active border/tint orange #f97316→#fb923c (orange-400). Pushed. Moved to Done.

## STATUS: Round 10 complete — Doing list drained.

## Round 11
- [x] `iInXSSPd` — Sidebar nav.departments "Müdürlükler"→"Departmanlar"; rebranded departments.* page strings Müdürlük(ler)→Departman(lar) (kept "Müdür"=manager + type-value options); added "Yönetim" (value Administration, existing enum label) to both create/edit type dropdowns. Pushed. Moved to Done.

## Round 12
- [x] `XLzwexhd` (reopened) — Çıkış button red now matches İptal Et: bg-[var(--color-destructive)] + hover:brightness-95 (was bg-red-600). Pushed. Moved to Done.
- [x] `Zm3d6Xu9` (reopened #3, root cause) — Department names under Gittiği Yer/Talep Yeri/Oluşturan weren't searchable because default toLowerCase() turns Turkish "İ" into "i"+combining-dot, breaking includes(). Switched all 3 banner searches (Jobs/Tasks/Incoming) to toLocaleLowerCase('tr') for query+haystack; also added createdByDisplayName/assignedUserDisplayName + all job.departments names to Jobs haystack (Oluşturan column). Pushed. Moved to Done.
- [x] `gQtqAh9g` — Wallboard "Son Tarihi Geçmiş Görevler" button: number white when 0 else red #ef4444; label always red. CSS via .stat-overdue/.is-zero classes. Pushed. Moved to Done.

## STATUS: Round 12 complete — Doing list drained.

## Round 13
- [x] `jgdkgrz4` — Departments İşlemler button "Müdür Ata"→"Yönetici Ata" (departments.assignManager tr + fallbacks); Users grid header + new-user form label "Müdürlük"→"Departman" (users.department tr, shared key). Pushed. Moved to Done.
- [x] `zvlsKa8U` — Allow Üst Düzey Yönetici (Reporter) to create requests: CreateJobCommand role guard now permits RoleCode.Reporter (no owner-dept restriction). Frontend already routes them to external form + lists all depts as owner. Pushed. Moved to Done.
- [x] `whhWlZfI` — Dashboard: hide "Bekleyen Görevlerim" card for Reporter (Üst Düzey Yönetici); staffMetrics omits myPendingTasks when isReporter (Staff/Operator unchanged). Pushed. Moved to Done.
- [x] `Z3zAkoW0` — Wallboard: Toplam Bekleyen/Birim İçi/Birim Dışı numbers turn white when 0 (added is-zero class + general `.is-zero span{color:#fff}`); non-zero stays orange, overdue rules unchanged. Pushed. Moved to Done.

## STATUS: Round 13 complete — Doing list drained.

## Round 14
- [x] `vHn5mTdW` — Reporter's external request now shows in target dept's "Onay Bekleyen Talepler": rows awaiting staff assignment (assignTargetDepartmentId) routed to pending-approval filter (and out of active), full-yellow row via .row-attention (overrides zebra), and Personel Ata list now includes the manager themselves (departmentUsers += current user). FE-only (owner is auto-approved for non-Staff). Pushed. Moved to Done.
- [x] `yyuspqnm` (reopened) — Wallboard table no longer has an inner vertical scroll: removed wallboard-table-shell max-height and set table-scroll overflow-y visible (overflow-x auto kept). Table renders full height, pagination sits right below (page scrolls like Birimdeki Görevler). Pushed. Moved to Done.
- [x] `VcbxO7g2` — Reporter Taleplerim: added "Yapılmakta Olan Taleplerim" chip after "Bekleyen Taleplerim". getMyRequestsView accepts in-progress; chip order [pending,in-progress,completed,rejected,all]; filterMyRequests split for Reporter — pending=Active&taskCount0, in-progress=Active&taskCount>0 (so once target mgr assigns staff/task created it moves to Yapılmakta Olan). Pushed. Moved to Done.

## STATUS: Round 14 complete — Doing list drained.
- [x] `z5IXBmo1` — Login desktop hero logo box height bumped slightly (h-14→h-16, 2xl:h-16→2xl:h-[4.5rem]); widths unchanged. Pushed. Moved to Done.
- [x] `b4NKnv5X` (reopened) — Self-requested-owner flow already implemented in edebad3 (approve-owner popup flags the creator who picked themselves). Aligned label text to card exactly: "(Görevi kendisi yapmak istiyor.)" (added period, tr+en+fallback). Pushed. Moved to Done.
- [x] `vHn5mTdW` (reopened) — Already implemented this session (commit 7928260): assignTargetDepartmentId rows → Onay Bekleyen (not Onaylanmış), full-yellow .row-attention. Verified intact on main; no code change needed. Moved to Done.

## STATUS: Round 14 (extended) complete — Doing list drained.
- [x] `lKLORn9n` (reopened) — Department Tasks grid owner column "Sahip" → "Görev Sahibi" (tasks.columns.owner tr; en "Owner"→"Task Owner"). Pushed. Moved to Done.
- [x] `yyuspqnm` (reopened #2) — Restored bounded wallboard-table-shell (max-height calc(100dvh-18rem)) so the pagination row stays pinned/visible without page-scrolling; table scrolls inside but the right scrollbar is hidden (scrollbar-width:none + webkit display:none). Prior attempt had removed the bound, causing a document scrollbar + pagination below the fold. Pushed. Moved to Done.

## Round 15
- [x] `GGxFLaip` — Yellow incoming row now persists after staff assigned: .row-attention triggers on active external incoming rows (kind external && status Active) instead of only assignTargetDepartmentId (which clears once a task is created). Darkened the yellow #fde68a→#fbbf24 (amber-400, orange-leaning), hover #f59e0b. Pushed. Moved to Done.
- [x] `z5IXBmo1` (reopened) — Increased login hero logo box height more (h-16→h-20, 2xl:h-[4.5rem]→2xl:h-24); widths unchanged. Pushed. Moved to Done.

## STATUS: Round 15 complete — Doing list drained.

## Round 16
- [x] `TcXvxFyf` — Removed "Seçim zorunlu değildir." from the assign/approve staff popup help text (assignStaffHelp tr/en + both inline fallbacks). Pushed. Moved to Done.
- [x] `mr3mhNbq` (reopened) — Increased login hero top/bottom spacing more (lg:py-10→py-16, 2xl:py-14→py-20) per arrow. Pushed. Moved to Done.

## STATUS: Round 16 complete — Doing list drained.

## Round 17
- [x] `z5IXBmo1` (reopened #2) — Login logo height was too tall (h-20/2xl:h-24); reduced to middle ground h-[4.5rem]/2xl:h-20. Pushed. Moved to Done.
- [x] `z5IXBmo1` (reopened #3) — Reverted login logo height to original h-14/2xl:h-16 ("eski haline getir"). Pushed. Moved to Done.

## Round 18
- [x] `YsCh570U` — "Görevin Talep Yeri/Oluşturan" column now shows the request creator (job.CreatedByUserId), not the approver. task.createdByDisplayName was the TASK creator, which for manager-assigned external tasks is the approver. Fixed projection in GetTasksQuery + GetTaskByIdQuery to resolve from the job's creator. Pushed. Moved to Done.

## Round 19
- [x] `gjVHpVxO` — Hide "İade Et" in the İptal/İade popup for Reporter-originated requests. Added CreatedByRoleCode to JobSummaryResponse (populated in JobQueries from creator's RoleCode) + FE JobSummary type + IncomingRequestRow.createdByRoleCode; modal hides İade Et when row.createdByRoleCode === 'Reporter'. Pushed. Moved to Done.

## STATUS: Round 19 complete — Doing list drained.
- [x] `GGxFLaip` (reopened) — On yellow attention rows, priority text under Talep No was unreadable (priority color near amber bg); now dark + extrabold (text-slate-900 font-extrabold) on those rows, priority color kept elsewhere. Pushed. Moved to Done.

## Round 20
- [x] `GGxFLaip` (reopened #2) — Priority text on yellow incoming rows changed from black to white (text-slate-900→text-white, font-extrabold). Pushed. Moved to Done.
- [x] `CSxXwjKS` — Target dept manager can now cancel an active Reporter request: CancelJobCommand isTargetManager now allows JobStatus.Active (was only PendingExternalApproval), removing the false "İş iptal yetkiniz yok." Pushed. Moved to Done.
- [x] `Zak5yDHj` — Login hero: removed content grid's extra top padding (pt-2 2xl:pt-4) so the gap above "Tire İletişim Merkezi" equals the gap below the footer note box (symmetric py). Pushed. Moved to Done.

## STATUS: Round 20 complete — Doing list drained.

## Round 21
- [x] `yyuspqnm` (reopened #3) — Made wallboard a fixed-height flex column (height:100dvh, overflow hidden); hero+stats flex-shrink:0; table-shell flex:1 1 auto min-height:0 (was hardcoded max-height calc(100dvh-18rem) which mismatched header+stats height and caused a document scrollbar). Table scrolls internally with hidden scrollbar; pagination pinned at bottom. Pushed. Moved to Done.

## Round 22
- [x] `lSO8pWbJ` — Reporter-originated request in Onay Bekleyen: İşlemler button label is "Onayla" instead of "Personel Ata" (same assign action); other active external rows keep "Personel Ata". Pushed. Moved to Done.
- [x] `iLOr9Q5y` — Yellow incoming row priority text now colour-coded by level: Çok Yüksek/Critical = standard red (text-red-600), Yüksek = light red (text-red-400), others white. Added attentionPriorityColorClass helper. Pushed. Moved to Done.

## STATUS: Round 22 complete — Doing list drained.

## Round 23
- [x] `yyuspqnm` (reopened #4) — Reversed: now show the standard app scrollbar on the wallboard grid. Removed scrollbar-hiding (scrollbar-width:none + webkit display:none) so the global *::-webkit-scrollbar style applies; fixed-height layout (pinned pagination + internal scroll) kept. Pushed. Moved to Done.

## Round 24
- [x] `iLOr9Q5y` (reopened) — High-priority light red was too light (red-400) on yellow rows; darkened to red-500 (still distinct from VeryHigh red-600). Pushed. Moved to Done.

## Round 25
- [x] `L2NCcB6x` — Removed "Düşük" (Low) option from Rutin Görev Oluştur priority dropdown. Pushed. Moved to Done.
- [x] `at3oWVCQ` — Updated Talep Oluştur kind descriptions: internal→"Kendi biriminizde birim içi talep sürecini oluşturun.", external→"Başka bir birime gidecek talep sürecini oluşturun." (tr locale + fallbacks). Pushed. Moved to Done.
- [x] `q12UV1ZH` — Son Tarih DueDatePill empty value now "Onay Bekleyen" (was "Belirsiz"). Pushed. Moved to Done.
- [x] `TwGPN6Jv` — Görev Tipi pill: green (success) tone on "Rutin", neutral on "Atanmış". Pushed. Moved to Done.
- [x] `f9lbGfbT` — Reduced wallboard stat button height ~30% (padding 0.85→0.55rem, number font clamp ~2.4rem max, smaller label) to free vertical space for 10 rows. Pushed. Moved to Done.
- [x] `Zg7XTWZx` — Warning (last-day) DueDatePill now solid yellow #facc15/border #eab308/text #422006 matching the "Onaylanmış Talepler" chip (was pale cream). Pushed. Moved to Done.
- [x] `ZsEvcCnJ` — Unified cancel buttons to "İptal/İade" in Görevlerim (TasksPage now always shows choose step) + Birime Gelen. İade option shown but passive (opacity/cursor + onClick guard, pointer-events kept) with "İade yapılamaz" hover tooltip when not returnable: TasksPage internal/routine (canReturn false), Incoming Reporter rows (supersedes gjVHpVxO hide→disable). Pushed. Moved to Done.
- [x] `pBpL8KSA` — Staff Görevlerim: tasks from Reporter requests now render a full-yellow (.row-attention) row and the İptal/İade button is passive (opacity/cursor + onClick guard + "İptal yetkiniz yok" tooltip) since staff can't cancel them. Added CreatedByRoleCode (job creator role) to TaskSummaryResponse + GetTasksQuery + FE Task type. Pushed. Moved to Done.

## STATUS: Round 25 complete — Doing list drained (8 cards).

## Round 26
- [x] `Vy58VVgv` — Follow-up to pBpL8KSA (G-2026-43 not yellow). Verified code is correct & on main: GetTasksQuery populates TaskSummaryResponse.CreatedByRoleCode from the job creator's RoleCode (same pattern as working gjVHpVxO on JobSummary), FE row applies .row-attention when createdByRoleCode==='Reporter'. Root cause: the round-25 backend change (TaskSummaryResponse field) requires the API to be rebuilt/restarted; the older incoming-list Reporter features work off an earlier deploy. No code change needed. Moved to Done — needs `docker-compose up -d --build api` (or dotnet restart) to take effect.
- [x] `Zr0yIf3d` — Clarifies pBpL8KSA: grid İptal/İade button now opens the popup (reverted grid-button disable), and inside the popup the "Görevi İptal Et" + İade options are passive (opacity/cursor + onClick guard + "İptal/İade yetkiniz yok" tooltip) for Reporter-originated tasks. Yellow row kept. (Depends on round-25 TaskSummary.createdByRoleCode → needs API rebuild.) Pushed. Moved to Done.

## STATUS: Round 26 complete — Doing list drained.

## Round 27
- [x] `TwGPN6Jv` (reopened) — Reversed: green (success) tone now on "Atanmış", neutral on "Rutin". Pushed. Moved to Done.
- [x] `Zg7XTWZx` (reopened) — Warning date pill now amber #fbbf24/border #f59e0b matching the wallboard Son Tarih yellow (was chip #facc15). Pushed. Moved to Done.
- [x] `taOkj8Gu` — İptal/İade not passive when a manager assigned the Reporter task to themselves: isReporterTask now `createdByRoleCode==='Reporter' && !isManagerLike`, so managers keep cancel/return; only staff are restricted. Pushed. Moved to Done.

## STATUS: Round 27 complete — Doing list drained.

## Round 28 (manual check after stop request)
- [x] `QGCJLtWm` — "Görevi Yönlendir" (task-route-button) forced light-blue with !important (Button primary variant's green bg utility was overriding the components-layer class). Pushed. Moved to Done.
- [x] `EH7MK87u` — Incoming "Personel Ata" → "Onayla" for all active external (from another dept) requests, not just Reporter. Pushed. Moved to Done.
- [x] `ZsEvcCnJ` (reopened) — Standard-user requests now show active İade in the popup: TasksPage choose-step İade passive only for Reporter tasks (removed the internal/routine !canReturn restriction); IncomingRequests already showed active İptal Et + İade Et for non-Reporter. Pushed. Moved to Done.

## Round 29 (manual check)
- [x] `8xnSiTR5` — Görevi Yönlendir user dropdown now excludes the current task assignee (returnDeptUsers filters out the routed task's assignedUserId when directRoute). Pushed. Moved to Done.

## Round 30 (manual check)
- [x] `QGCJLtWm` (reopened) — Görevi Yönlendir button now a real blue (#0ea5e9 bg / #0284c7 border / white text, hover #0284c7) — previous light blue too light. Pushed. Moved to Done.
- [x] `7RspesWl` — Added "Durum" column after Başlık in the İptal/İade Talepler (cancelled/rejected) views of Incoming/Jobs/Tasks grids, showing İptal (Cancelled) vs İade (Rejected/RevisionRequested). Added cancelReturnStatus i18n key (tr/en). Pushed. Moved to Done.
- [x] `X705MbI5` — Added top-right X close icon to the task İptal/İade/Yönlendir modal (closeReturnModal). Pushed. Moved to Done.

## Round 31 (manual check)
- [x] `X705MbI5` (reopened) — Route/return modal X close icon hover now red (hover:bg-red-50 hover:text-red-600); for directRoute (Görevi Birim İçi Yönlendir) the "Geri" button reads "Çıkış" and closes. Added common.exit (tr/en). Pushed. Moved to Done.
- [x] `7RspesWl` (reopened) — Durum column now shows plain "İptal"/"İade" (was "İptal Et"/"İade Et" from jobs.actions keys) in Incoming/Jobs/Tasks. Pushed. Moved to Done.

## Round 32 (manual check)
- [x] `7RspesWl` (reopened) — Durum column now a FilterableTh (sort + filter) in Incoming/Jobs/Tasks; added cancelReturnStatus to each grid's column accessor (İptal/İade). Pushed. Moved to Done.
- [x] `pE3EAIQ7` — Removed Son Tarih column from the İptal/İade (cancelled/rejected) views in Incoming/Jobs/Tasks. Pushed. Moved to Done.
- [x] `8J3uzZuF` — Görevlerim choose popup İade button relabeled "Görevi İade Et" (İptal already "Görevi İptal Et"); routing redirect label kept. Pushed. Moved to Done.
- [x] `ZsEvcCnJ` (reopened) — Incoming İptal/İade popup buttons: cancel action "İptal" (was "İptal Et"), dismiss "Vazgeç" (common.dismiss, was colliding with common.cancel="İptal"); İade Et unchanged. Added common.dismiss + tasks.actions.returnTask (tr/en). Pushed. Moved to Done.

## Round 33 (manual check)
- [x] `11N4MFvZ` — Pending-approval İptal prompt confirm button now "İptali Onayla" (was default "Onayla"). Pushed. Moved to Done.
- [x] `7RspesWl` (reopened #2) — Durum column now sortable: injected cancelReturnStatus property onto rows (Incoming/Jobs/Tasks) so useSortable obj[sortKey] works; filter already via column accessor. Pushed. Moved to Done.
- [x] `u5coQlbm` — Added red-hover X close icon (top-right) to shared PromptDialog + ConfirmDialog and the Incoming cancel/return + staff-assign modals (route modal already had it). Pushed. Moved to Done.
- [x] `qpgXDcLh` — "Görevi İade Et" now returns directly to the task owner (görev sahibi) without the routing screen: new 'returnOwner' step (reason only) → requestTaskRevision(taskId, reason, ownerUserId) → RevisionRequested with owner as approver. Added OwnerUserId to TaskSummaryResponse + GetTasksQuery + FE Task type. Reporter routing case keeps the 'return' (Görevi Birim İçi Yönlendir) screen. Pushed. Moved to Done.

## STATUS: Round 33 complete — Doing list drained.

## Round 34 (manual check)
- [x] `IM1wf1dA` — Wallboard: added red "Çıkış" button next to "Yenile" → navigates to home (/). Pushed. Moved to Done.
- [x] `eXTCjF9l` — Wallboard rows for Reporter-originated tasks now amber (#fbbf24, dark text) via .reporter-row (item.isReporterRequest from job.createdByRoleCode). Pushed. Moved to Done.

## Round 35 (manual check)
- [x] `7RspesWl` (reopened #3, filter) — Column filters were case-broken for Turkish "İ" (İptal/İade) because useColumnFilters.matchesFilters used default toLowerCase(); switched to toLocaleLowerCase('tr'). Fixes Durum filter (and all column filters) for Turkish text. Pushed. Moved to Done.
- [x] `MrqUHoyC` — Bildirimler bell now reflects all request/task lifecycle changes: GetNotificationsQuery merges real (push) notifications with an audit-log-derived feed for the current user's own jobs + assigned/owned/created tasks. AuditLog Action mapped to Turkish titles (Talep/Görev oluşturuldu/onaylandı/iptal/iade vb.), message from Notes/Details + actor, link to /my-requests|/my-tasks. Audit entries marked read so they don't inflate the unread badge. Backend-only (bell renders the contract). Pushed. Moved to Done.

## STATUS: Round 35 complete — Doing list drained.

## Round 36 (manual check)
- [x] `UWHsvfFj` — Removed İade from the cancel flow: grid "İptal/İade" buttons → "İptal" in TasksPage + IncomingRequests; clicking goes straight to the cancel-reason popup (TasksPage openReturnModal → 'cancel' step; IncomingRequests openCancelReturn → prompt). Task popup keeps "Görev" wording; request popup says "Talebi İptal Et" (Talep, not Görev). Reporter cancel restriction preserved (staff button passive). Choose/İade-Et UI now unreachable. Pushed. Moved to Done.

## STATUS: Round 36 complete — Doing list drained.

## Round 37 (Jun 15 — Doing list, 8 cards)
- [x] `#377` (6a2e8e13) — Bell unread count now a round red badge with white number (was bare red text); rounded-full bg-red-600 text-white ring-2 ring-white. NotificationBell.tsx.
- [x] `#441` (6a304f84) — Birim Dışı Talep Oluştur coordination texts: "Koordineli Birimler"→"Koordine Departmanlar", placeholder "Birim/Müdürlük seçin"→"Koordine Departman seçin", help "...ek birimler."→"...ek departmanlar." Same strings aligned in IncomingRequests coordinated modal. CreateRequestPage + IncomingRequestsPage.
- [x] `#436` (6a300106) — JobsPage detail popup coordination button "Koordine Birim Ekle"→"Koordine Departman Ekle" (heading was already correct).
- [x] `#442` (6a3051fd) — Request detail popup (Taleplerim/Birime Gelen/Birimden Giden) bottom section now 3 columns: Koordine Departman Ekle | Adres Bilgileri (opsiyonel adres alanları, veri varsa) | Ekler/Fotoğraflar. Added renderJobAddressInfo + Adres section for non-coordination (staff) viewers. JobsPage.
- [x] `#438` (6a304a70) — Task detail popup: removed the redundant header "Görevi Yönlendir" button (the inline "Görevi Yönlendir" column does the same routing); enlarged that section's heading/help/select/button (text-2xl, h-12 select, size lg full-width button). TasksPage.
- [x] `#431` (6a2ff8d1) — Removed the standalone JobsPage "Birime Gelen Talepler" list page (duplicate of /incoming-requests): /request-details with no jobId now redirects to /incoming-requests?kind=all; closing a detail in external mode returns to /incoming-requests (or /social for social context); GlobalSearchBar external results open the detail directly with jobId. JobsPage + GlobalSearchBar.
- [x] `#440` (6a304dc0) — Pending requests now surface in notifications: NotificationAudience.GetManagerPendingJobIdsAsync adds a manager's pending incoming ("Onay Bekleyen Talepler") + outgoing ("Bekleyen Talepler") jobs (status Pending(Owner|External)Approval where their managed dept is owner or Target) to the visible-entity set, so both the bell feed AND unread count include them consistently; their "Detay" opens the approvable incoming detail. Backend: NotificationAudience + GetNotificationsQuery.
- [x] `#439` (6a304cae) — Notifications: row click no longer navigates; only the "Detay" button opens the detail (and marks read). Detail popups (Jobs/Tasks z-[120]) now layer ABOVE the notifications modal (z-100) so the notifications popup stays behind. NotificationBell + JobsPage + TasksPage.

### Verification (Round 37)
- Frontend `npm run build` (tsc -b + vite) — PASS.
- Backend `dotnet build` full solution — PASS (had to clear pre-existing runaway nested `bin/` recursion + stray `bin\Debug` literal dir in the Api project; unrelated to these changes).
- `npm run lint` — clean for all touched files (2 pre-existing errors remain in untouched RichTextEditor.tsx / date-time-picker.tsx).
- Runtime E2E NOT performed: no demo seed is configured in any appsettings (`SeedData:EnableDemoData` unset → off), so a fresh DB has no managers/requests/notifications to exercise cards #431/#440/#439 without heavy manual data setup. Note: this contradicts CLAUDE.md which claims demo seed is on in dev config.

## STATUS: Round 37 complete — Doing list drained (8 cards).

## Round 38 (#443 — arrived mid-session, user chose "implement now")
- [x] `#443` (6a30569e) — Vatandaş Talepleri redesign: removed the inline Müdürlük dropdown, İş başlığı input, Yönlendir/Sil/İşe çevir buttons and the "Konuşmayı Aç" link + slide-in conversation. Each unconverted citizen message now has a single "Talep Oluştur" button that opens a new `CitizenRequestModal` — a two-pane pop-up with the related WhatsApp conversation (ConversationPanel) on the left and the full "Birim Dışı Talep Oluştur" form on the right (Talep Başlığı, Talebin Gideceği Birim, Koordineli + Koordine Departmanlar, Öncelik, Proje, Başlangıç/Son tarih, Adres, Açıklama). Submit creates an ExternalUnit job linked to the message. Backend: extended ConvertSocialMessageToJobCommand/Request + controller to accept RequestType/TargetDepartmentIds/IsProject/StartDate/address; handler passes them to CreateJobCommand (defaults preserve old Citizen behavior). FE: new CitizenRequestModal.tsx, api client convert payload extended, SocialMessagesPage rewired. Converted rows keep "Detaylar".
  - Verification: frontend build PASS, backend Api build PASS, lint clean for touched files. Runtime E2E not run (no demo seed → no social messages/conversations to exercise without manual setup).

## STATUS: Round 38 complete — Doing list drained.

## Round 39 (live review feedback on Round 37 work)
- [x] `#438` (reopened) — Round-37 enlargement was too big; shrank the task-detail "Görevi Yönlendir" section back down (h3 text-2xl→text-base, removed helper text-base / select h-12 text-base / full-width lg button → default field-select + size sm). TasksPage.
- [x] `#445` — Notification row click now marks the notification read only (no navigation); detail still opens solely via the "Detay" button (refines Round-37 #439 where the row did nothing). NotificationBell.
- [x] `#444` — Detail popup opened from a notification must appear above the notifications modal and, on X, leave the notifications open. Root cause: detail modals render inside the content `zoom` stacking context, so a z-index alone can't lift them above the body-portaled notifications modal. Fix: portal the Tasks + Jobs detail modals to `document.body` (same technique the notifications modal already documents) at z-[120] > notifications z-[100]; closing the detail never touches the notifications modal. TasksPage + JobsPage.
  - Verification: frontend build PASS, lint clean for touched files. Runtime not exercised (no demo seed). Note: portaling the detail modals also makes them render at full viewport scale (was content-zoom ~0.81) — intended/acceptable for a focal overlay.

## STATUS: Round 39 complete.

## Round 40
- [x] `#446` — "Birim Dışı Talep Oluştur" target dropdown placeholder "Birim/Müdürlük seçin" → "Departman seçiniz" (CreateRequestPage); aligned CitizenRequestModal target placeholder to the same key. Build PASS.

## Round 41
- [x] `#447` — Bell unread badge nudged a bit further out (-right-2.5/-top-2.5 → -right-3.5/-top-3.5). NotificationBell.
- [x] `#443` (reopened, no feedback) — Likely cause: CitizenRequestModal rendered inside the content `zoom` stacking context (same issue as #444), so the popup appeared mis-scaled/clipped. Fix: portal CitizenRequestModal to document.body. Build PASS. If the real issue was different, awaiting clarification.

## Round 42 (direct feedback)
- [x] Detay popups too tall after the #444 portal (scale went 0.81→1.0). Lowered Jobs + Tasks detail modals from forced `h-[92dvh] max-h-[92dvh]` to `max-h-[80dvh]` (caps + sizes to content). Build PASS. (Citizen "Talep Oluştur" popup left as-is — out of scope of "Detay" popups.)

## Round 43 (new Doing cards)
- [x] `#462` — Detay popups (Jobs + Tasks detail modals) height-only bump max-h-[72dvh] → max-h-[80dvh] (notification list modal left at 72dvh — it's bell-opened, not a Detay popup). JobsPage + TasksPage.
- [x] `#459` — Manager Taleplerim "Birim Dışı Onay Bekleyen Talepler" grid was empty: filterMyRequests external-pending required status PendingExternalApproval AND hasPendingTargetDepartment(job, activeDept) — but in Taleplerim the active dept is the OWNER (never a target), so it always excluded everything; it also missed the owner-approved-awaiting-target-staff state. Fixed: external-pending now = ExternalUnit && (PendingExternalApproval || (Active && taskCount===0)) && !overdue (mirrors what the target manager sees in Birime Gelen → Onay Bekleyen). Removed now-unused hasPendingTargetDepartment helper. JobsPage. Build + lint PASS.

## Round 44
- [x] `#463` — Detay popup coordination block: shrank "Koordine Departman seçin" placeholder font (new MultiSelectDropdown triggerClassName prop → text-xs) and narrowed the "Koordine Departman Ekle" button (size sm). JobsPage + multi-select-dropdown.
- [x] `#453` — Yönetici Notu: added Job.ManagerNote (+ migration AddJobManagerNote), SetJobManagerNoteCommand + POST /jobs/{id}/manager-note, JobDetailResponse.ManagerNote. FE: editable note (textarea + green "Ekle") in Birimden Giden → Bekleyen detail while target hasn't approved (PendingOwnerApproval/PendingExternalApproval/Active+noTasks); read-only display in Birime Gelen (incoming) detail. JobsPage + api client + types. Build (FE+BE) + lint PASS.

## Round 45
- [x] `#452` — Düzenle (edit) flow for pending requests. JobsPage Taleplerim list: light-turquoise "Düzenle" button right of "Detaylar", shown while editable (isPreApprovalStatus OR manager Active+taskCount0); navigates to /requests/new?kind=…&editJobId=…. CreateRequestPage edit mode: prefill external/internal form from job (title/desc/priority/dates/isProject/address + target+coordinated from Target depts), submit calls updateJob (button label → "Güncelle"), default owner-dept effects guarded so prefill isn't clobbered. Backend: UpdateJobCommand/Request/controller expanded with IsProject/Neighborhood/Street/OpenAddress + TargetDepartmentIds reconciliation (pre-approval external only; replace Target rows, keep Owner). Build (FE+BE) + lint PASS. Note: runtime not exercised (no seed); target-dept reconciliation guarded to pre-approval.

## Round 46 (5 cards)
- [x] `#462` (reopened, screenshot) — Detay popups grew unbounded tall on 27" (80dvh≈1152px). Capped absolute height: max-h-[min(85dvh,52rem)] (Jobs+Tasks) so big monitors stay compact like the screenshot; small screens still use 85dvh.
- [x] `#457` — Manager Taleplerim "Yapılmakta Olan Taleplerim" chip active bg orange→yellow (new .scope-chip--in-progress-yellow; applied when in-progress && isManagerLike). globals.css + JobsPage.
- [x] `#464` — Detay popup Koordine Departman MultiSelectDropdown now opens upward (new openUp prop → bottom-full mb-2). Personel seçiniz is a native <select> (browser auto-positions upward near viewport bottom).
- [x] `#465`+`#466` — Yönetici Notu moved from a row below into the coordination grid as the 3rd column (right of Adres Bilgileri); grid becomes 4 cols (Koordine|Adres|Yönetici Notu|Ekler) when shown. Birimden Giden→Bekleyen: editable. Birime Gelen: read-only — shows the note, or "Yönetici Notu girilmemiş" when empty.
- Build (FE) + lint PASS. Runtime not exercised (no seed).

## Round 47 (4 cards)
- [x] `#469` — Taleplerim "Düzenle" button background light→dark turquoise (bg-teal-700). JobsPage.
- [x] `#467` — Manager note "Ekle" now shows an info popup "Notunuz Eklendi" (ConfirmDialog hideCancel) after save. JobsPage.
- [x] `#464` (reopened) — Görevi Yönlendir "Personel seçiniz" converted from native <select> to new SingleSelectDropdown with openUp (opens upward). TasksPage + single-select-dropdown.tsx.
- [x] `#468` — Yönetici Notu column now shows in ALL request detail contexts (showManagerNoteColumn = isRequestDetailContext; read-only "Yönetici Notu girilmemiş" when empty). In the Task detail, added a read-only Yönetici Notu column (parent job's note) right of Atama Geçmişi (grid 3→4 cols for managers). JobsPage + TasksPage.
- Build (FE) + lint PASS.

## Round 48
- [x] `#470` — Manager's own Birim İçi (internal) request assigned to self/staff didn't show in "Yapılmakta Olan Taleplerim": the in-progress manager filter required hasApprovedTargetDepartment (only valid for external). Now internal Active+taskCount>0 jobs qualify directly (requestType==='InternalUnit' || hasApprovedTargetDepartment). JobsPage. Build + lint PASS.

## Round 49 (2 cards — print popup)
- [x] `#565` — Print window height now matches the detail popup behind it. Both print fns measure the open detail modal (`document.querySelector('.detail-modal-shell').offsetHeight`, fallback 832) and pass it to `getCenteredPopupFeatures(820, …)` instead of the fixed 832. JobsPage + TasksPage.
- [x] `#570` — Reverted regressions from "Clean print popup chrome" (21926e4): removed `@page{margin:0}` (it zeroed page margins → killed left/right alignment AND the browser's default "1/1" page-number footer), and restored the `.footer` CSS + `<div class="footer">Yazdırma tarihi: …</div>`. Matches the pre-regression state (da2390d). JobsPage + TasksPage.
- Build (FE) + lint PASS. Runtime not exercised (no seed; print needs an open detail modal with data).

## Round 50 (1 card — print chrome)
- [x] `#571` — Remove the browser's native print header/footer (top-left date, top-center "about:blank" title, bottom-left "about:blank" URL) while keeping a "1/1" page number. These are all the browser's all-or-nothing print chrome (only toggled by `@page` margin), so: re-added `@page{margin:0}` to suppress ALL native chrome; restored left/right (and top/bottom) margins via `@media print{body{padding:1.5cm}}`; and rendered our own print-only bottom-right `.page-number` ("1 / 1"). Decided with the user (native "1/1" can't be kept while removing the about:blank/date). JobsPage + TasksPage. Build (FE) + lint PASS.
  - Caveat: the custom "1 / 1" is a fixed bottom-right indicator, accurate for the typical single-page printout; a multi-page print would repeat "1 / 1" (no cross-browser way to paginate counters in Chrome).

## Round 51 (3 cards)
- [x] `#573` — Print → Save as PDF filename was "download". Set the print doc `<title>` to the number (TasksPage → `taskDisplayNumber` / Görev No, JobsPage → `jobDisplayNumber` / Talep No). Title is still hidden from the printout (suppressed by `@page{margin:0}` from #571) but drives the PDF filename. JobsPage + TasksPage.
- [x] `#572` — Enlarged two helper texts (cancel-request "…neden belirtiniz." + route-within-unit "Görev sadece aynı birim içinde yönlendirilebilir.") via inline `fontSize:0.85rem` so only these `.helper-copy` instances grow (base is 0.76rem / 0.66rem in the zoomed shell — global change avoided). JobsPage + IncomingRequestsPage (cancel popup) + TasksPage (route popup).
- [x] `#574` — Address labels (Mahalle, Cadde / Sokak / Bulvar, Açık Adres) bumped `text-xs`→`text-sm` in CreateRequestPage `renderAddressFields` (shared by internal + external forms).
- Build (FE) + lint PASS.

## Round 52 (2 bug cards)
- [x] `#576` — Notifications → task detail showed Görev No as `taskId.slice(0,8)` hash and Atanan as a raw user GUID. Root: `TaskDetailResponse` lacked the number + display names. Added `AssignedDepartmentName`, `AssignedUserDisplayName`, `TaskNumber`, `TaskNumberYear` to the contract (appended — no positional reshuffle), resolved them in `GetTaskByIdQuery`, mirrored on FE `TaskDetail` type, and updated `NotificationBell` (`formatTaskNumber` → `G-{year}-{n}`; Atanan → displayName ?? deptName ?? '—'). BE + FE build + lint PASS.
- [x] `#577` — Görevlerim › Tüm Görevlerim: empty search collapsed the grid headers (overlap). Root: `my-tasks-all-table` uses `table-layout:fixed` (card 548); the empty `colSpan={99}` row inflates the column model under fixed layout and squeezes the `nowrap` headers. Fix: add `data-table--empty` class when `pagedTasks.length===0` and override to `table-layout:auto` for that case (matches the working Jobs empty grid). TasksPage + globals.css. Build + lint PASS.

## Round 53 (2 cards)
- [x] `#578` — Enlarged the task-cancel popup helper "Görevi iptal etmek için neden belirtiniz." (TasksPage:1386) via inline `fontSize:0.85rem` (same treatment as #572; the IncomingRequestsPage instance was already covered by #572).
- [x] `#579` — Banner 1st line (kicker) + 3rd line (subtitle) enlarged. Split `.page-kicker` out of the shared shell override so only the banner kicker grows (0.66→0.76rem), bumped `.page-subtitle` shell size 0.78→0.88rem, and base `.page-kicker` 0.72→0.8rem. globals.css. Build + lint PASS.

## Round 54 (1 feature card)
- [x] `#575` — Routine tasks: Adres Bilgisi + Dosya/Fotoğraf on the create form, and Adres Bilgileri + Ekler/Fotoğraflar in the Görevlerim routine detail. Key insight: CreateRoutineTask already creates a synthetic Job (SourceType=Routine) that has the address fields; attachments use the Task bucket (same as the existing complete-card uploader, card 528).
  - BE: added Neighborhood/Street/OpenAddress to `CreateRoutineTaskRequest` + `CreateRoutineTaskCommand` (optional), set on the Job in the handler, passed through in `TasksController.CreateRoutine`. No migration (Job already has address fields).
  - FE: `api.createRoutineTask` signature + RoutineTaskPage (address fields mirroring CreateRequestPage + pendingFiles photo upload → `uploadTaskAttachment` after create). TasksPage detail: new routine-only 2nd row with Adres Bilgileri (from parentJobDetail, "Adres bilgisi girilmemiş." when empty) + read-only Ekler/Fotoğraflar (`taskDetail.attachments`, empty "Rutin Görev için ek/fotoğraf bulunmamaktadır.", amber lock "Rutin görev tamamlandığı için sonradan Ek/Fotoğraf eklenemez." when Completed). New i18n keys attachments.routineEmpty/routineLocked (tr+en).
  - BE + FE build + lint PASS. Runtime not exercised (no seed).

## Round 55 (1 card)
- [x] `#580` — Notification "Detay" now deep-links to the real page popup instead of the bell's own inline popup: task → `/my-tasks?view=all&taskId=<id>` (Görevlerim opens the task detail), job → `/my-requests?view=all&jobId=<id>` (Taleplerim opens the request detail). `handleNavigate` in NotificationBell now uses `useNavigate` + `parseNotificationDetailTarget`, closing the dropdown/modal. The bell's inline detail popup is now unreachable (flagged for cleanup). Build + lint PASS.

## Round 56 (3 cards)
- [x] `#581` — Explicitly block dangerous file extensions on upload (.exe, .bat, .msi, .dmg, .iso, .tar, .xz, … 30 total). Added a `BlockedExtensions` denylist to `UploadAttachmentCommandHandler`, checked before the allowlist with a security message. Note: the existing allowlist (jpg/png/pdf/Office only) already rejected these — the denylist is explicit defense-in-depth. BE build PASS.
- [x] `#582` — Routine create form: aligned Adres Bilgisi + Dosya/Fotoğraf layout to match Talep Oluştur exactly (single group: Mahalle|Cadde row, then Açık Adres|Upload row) instead of two separate columns. RoutineTaskPage. Build + lint PASS.
- [x] `#583` — Routine detail Adres Bilgileri: headings now side by side (values beneath) via `flex flex-wrap` instead of the stacked `dl space-y-2`. TasksPage. Build + lint PASS.

## Round 57 (1 card)
- [x] `#584` — Birime Gelen Talepler grid: "Talep Yeri / Oluşturan" header now renders on two lines without the slash ("Talep Yeri" / "Oluşturan"). Single shared table header (line 658) → two `t()` calls with `<br/>`; added `incomingRequests.columns.requestLocation` + `.creator` keys (tr+en). Build + lint PASS.

## Round 58 (3 cards — Doing batch)
- [x] `#594` — Wallboard ("Ekrana yansıt") Görev No column was missing the `G-` prefix (showed `2026/98`). Added a dedicated `formatTaskNumber` → `G-{year}-{n}` in WallboardPage, aligning the wallboard with the app-wide task-number format (also normalised the `/` separator to `-` for consistency with TasksPage/NotificationBell). jobNumber (unused in render) keeps the generic `formatNumber`.
- [x] `#593` — Balanced title wrapping in all gridviews: long `Başlık` text now splits ~half/half across lines instead of orphaning words. Added `text-wrap: balance` to `.cell-title` (Tasks/Jobs/IncomingRequests grids) and switched `.wallboard-row-title` from nowrap+ellipsis to `white-space:normal` + `overflow-wrap:break-word` + `text-wrap:balance` (wallboard). globals.css only.
- [x] `#589` — "Yeni" blinking green badge under the Görev Tarihi value in Görevlerim while the task's assignment-to-staff date is still today. Derived `AssignedAtUtc` (latest AssignmentHistory `ToUserId == AssignedUserId`, covers Assign + Claim) as a no-migration projection in `GetTasksQuery`; added optional trailing `AssignedAtUtc` to `TaskSummaryResponse`. FE: `Task.assignedAtUtc`, `isAssignedToday()` gate (only `isMyTasksView`), `.task-new-badge` blink keyframe (`@keyframes ccc-blink`, respects `prefers-reduced-motion`), `tasks.badges.new` i18n (tr/en).
- BE build + FE build + lint + 10 backend tests PASS. Runtime not exercised (no seed; needs tasks assigned today / open wallboard items).

## Round 59 (1 fix — notification deep-link)
- [x] Notification "Detay" for a **görev** only opened the Görevlerim popup when the task was in the user's "mine" list (`tasks.find` in TasksPage auto-open effect) — so notifications about tasks **not assigned to the viewer** opened nothing. Talep already worked because JobsPage fetches by id. Added `openTaskDetailById` fallback: when the deep-linked task isn't in the loaded list, fetch it by id (`api.getTaskById` — tenant-scoped, no auth gate) + parent job, derive the `selectedTask` summary, and open the same popup. Guarded with `autoOpenInFlightRef` + `!loading` so the common (in-list) path is unchanged. FE build + lint PASS.
  - The original "small inline popup" symptom was a stale PWA cache (deployed #580 code already navigates); this closes the remaining real gap.

## Round 60 (Doing batch 2)
- [x] `#597` — Cap gridview title wrap at **2 lines** (refines #593): `.cell-title` + `.wallboard-row-title` now use `display:-webkit-box` + `-webkit-line-clamp:2` (kept `text-wrap:balance` so a 2-line title still splits ~half; `.cell-title` gets `margin-inline:auto` to stay centered now that it's block-level). Verified via Chrome injection: short=1 line, medium=2, very-long clamped 2 (scrollHeight 74→clientHeight 37). globals.css only. FE build + lint PASS.

## Round 61 (Doing batch — 5 cards)
- [x] `#628` — Gridview "Son Tarih" altındaki **(Ek süre talebi)** işareti geri geldi. Kök neden: `061e033` "Preserve task status during extra-time approval" ek süre talebinde görev durumunu artık `RevisionRequested`'a çekmiyor (Assigned/InProgress kalıyor), oysa işaret `task.currentStatus === 'RevisionRequested'`'a bağlıydı → hiç görünmüyordu. Çözüm: `TaskSummaryResponse.HasPendingExtraTimeRequest` (Approvals'ta `TaskRevision`+`Pending` var mı) projeksiyonu GetTasksQuery'e eklendi; FE `Task.hasPendingExtraTimeRequest` + TasksPage işaret koşulu güncellendi. Şema değişmedi, migration yok.
- [x] `#629` — Tüm gridview'larda **Talep Tarihi** yönetici onayında değişiyordu. Kök neden: birim içi talep onaylanınca (`ApproveJobOwnerCommand` → `EnsureOwnerTasksAsync(... utcNow)`) görevler o an oluşturuluyor; IncomingRequestsPage `toInternalRow` ise "Talep Tarihi" için `task.createdAtUtc` (=onay anı) kullanıyordu. Çözüm: `TaskSummaryResponse.JobCreatedAtUtc` (bağlı talebin oluşturulma tarihi) projeksiyonu eklendi; FE `Task.jobCreatedAtUtc`; `toInternalRow` artık `task.jobCreatedAtUtc ?? task.createdAtUtc`. (`approvedAtUtc` sütunu görev createdAt'inde kaldı — onay anı doğru.)
- [x] `#627` — Ek süre talebi reddedilince sağ alttaki balon yeşil yerine **kırmızı**. TasksPage toast state'i `{ message, type }` + `showToast(msg, type)` helper'ına çevrildi; sadece red akışı `'error'` (Toast bileşeni zaten error=rose desteği veriyordu).
- [x] `#630` — Ekler / Fotoğraflar bölümünde **önizleme (resim küçük görseli) kaldırıldı**; her yüklü dosya yalnızca FileText ikonu + adıyla gösteriliyor. AttachmentSection: `IMAGE_EXTENSIONS`/`isImageAttachment` + `<img>` dalı + gereksiz hover ad katmanı silindi.
- [x] `#612` — Vatandaş Talepleri banner altındaki WhatsApp butonu + gridview'ı. İnceleme: zaten `da84d7f` "Refine citizen request workflow" ile geri getirilmiş (WhatsApp ilk kanal çipi + gridview WhatsApp mesajlarını gösteriyor + "Yazışmalar" butonu; backend GetSocialMessagesQuery WhatsApp'ı hariç tutmuyor). HEAD = origin/main = deploy, kodda eksik yok — muhtemelen stale PWA cache. Kod değişikliği yapılmadı; kullanıcıya soruldu.
- BE build + FE build + lint PASS. Runtime exercise edilmedi (seed yok).

## Round 62 (1 card — reopened #551)
- [x] `#551` (reopened, T-2026-109) — Birime Gelen Talepler → Detaylar pop-up'ında açıklamada hâlâ düz **`&nbsp;`** görünüyordu. Önceki düzeltme (`2689926`, RichTextContent `decodeHtmlEntities`) yalnızca **düz metin** dalını çözüyordu; `<p>` etiketli açıklamalar rich-text dalından (`dangerouslySetInnerHTML`) geçiyor ve **çift kodlanmış** `&amp;nbsp;` düz `&nbsp;` olarak render ediliyordu. Kök neden: RichTextEditor `escapeHtml` `&`→`&amp;` yapıyor; düz metin içinde `&nbsp;` olan değer kaydedilince `&amp;nbsp;` oluyor. Çözüm: RichTextContent'e `normalizeNbsp` eklendi — tek/çift/çoklu kodlanmış `&nbsp;` ve gerçek U+00A0 baştan normal boşluğa indirgenir (`/&(?:amp;)*nbsp;/gi` + ` `), böylece hem düz metin hem HTML dalı düzelir. Meşru `&amp;` (AT&T) korunur. FE build + lint PASS; regex 6 senaryoda node ile doğrulandı. (Print yolu kart kapsamı dışı; salt-okunur display düzeltmesi tüm mevcut kayıtları da kapsar.)

## Round 63 (Doing batch — 4 cards; çoğu deploy'da mevcut, stale PWA cache şüphesi)
- [x] `#635` — Vatandaş Talepleri banner'ı diğer sayfalardan kısaydı çünkü `page-kicker` satırı yoktu (diğer sayfalar kicker+başlık+alt başlık 3 satır; social 2 satır). SocialMessagesPage header'a `<div class="page-kicker">{t('nav.social')}</div>` eklendi → yükseklik eşitlendi. FE build + lint PASS.
- [x] `#631` — Ekler/Fotoğraflar detay pop-up'ında dosyaya tıklayınca **inmiyordu**: kutucuk `<a href={statik /uploads}>` ile dosyayı indirmek yerine tarayıcıda açıyordu; yalnızca küçük ↓ butonu kimlik doğrulamalı gerçek indirme yapıyordu. Çözüm: tüm kutucuk artık `handleDownload` (api.downloadAttachment → blob → kaydet) tetikliyor; statik link + kullanılmayan `resolveAttachmentUrl` importu kaldırıldı. Yükleme progress bar'ı zaten vardı (5a52ab1, AttachmentSection satır 137-141). FE build + lint PASS.
- [x] `#621` — "WhatsApp konuşmaları gridview'de satır olmasın" + "whatsapp tamamen kaybolmuş". Grid'den hariç tutma zaten `1e36cc9` ile yapılmıştı AMA o commit WhatsApp'a erişimi de tamamen kaldırmıştı (çip + Yazışmalar butonu silindi, nav item yok → /whatsapp ulaşılamaz). Eksik parça buydu: SocialMessagesPage scope-chips'e MessageCircle ikonlu "WhatsApp Yazışmaları" çipi eklendi → `navigate('/whatsapp')` (konuşmalar grid satırı olmadan erişilebilir). `useNavigate` + `MessageCircle` geri eklendi; `whatsapp.navLabel` i18n (tr/en). FE build + lint PASS.
- [x] `#634` — Talep/görev süreçlerindeki değişiklikler ilgili tüm kullanıcıların **rozetinde uyarı** versin (kullanıcı: "gerçek okunmamış uyarı"). Olaylar zaten feed'de görünüyordu (AuditLog türevli) ama daima okundu işaretliydi → rozet saymıyordu. Çözüm (çift kayıt/​"tek tıkla çoklu azalma" hatası olmadan): `NotificationReadCursor` imlecini kullanarak imleçten sonraki + kullanıcının kendi yapmadığı AuditLog olayları okunmamış sayılır. `GetUnreadNotificationCountQuery` artık gerçek okunmamış + (ilgili entity'ler için imleç sonrası, aktör≠kullanıcı) AuditLog sayısını topluyor. `GetNotificationsQuery` türev satırların `IsRead`'ini imlece göre veriyor + `IsHistorical:true` işaretliyor. `NotificationResponse.IsHistorical` (trailing optional) eklendi; FE `AppNotification.isHistorical`; NotificationBell geçmiş satırları tek tek okumaz (`canMarkRead = !isRead && !isHistorical`), yalnızca "Hepsini okundu yap" imleci ilerletir. Rozet FE'de 30 sn'de bir poll'leniyor → olaylar ~30 sn içinde uyarı veriyor. BE build + 10 test + FE build + lint PASS. Migration yok.
- **KRİTİK build hotfix**: `301cccf` (paralel commit) `AttachmentsController.Download` içinde `CurrentContext.RequireTenantId()` kullanıyor ama `using CityCommunicationCenter.Application;` eklenmemiş → **backend HEAD'de derlenmiyordu**. Yani 301cccf'den beri backend deploy olmuyordu → indirme uç noktası canlı değildi (#631'in gerçek kök nedeni, stale cache değil). Eksik using eklendi; backend tekrar derleniyor.
- Not: #621/#631 stale cache değil, gerçek eksiklerdi (erişim noktası / tile indirme / backend derleme). #610 reprodüksiyonla doğrulandı (sorun yok). #612 zaten deploy'daydı.
- FE build + lint + BE build + 10 test PASS.

## Round 64 (Doing batch — 11 kart; gruplar halinde işleniyor)
- [x] `#641` — Talep onaylanınca bildirimde "CreatedTasks=N" teknik detayı görünüyordu (ApproveJobOwnerCommand Details, comment yoksa). GetNotificationsQuery `FormatNote` artık "CreatedTasks=" ile başlayan notları gizliyor.
- [x] `#639` — Bildirimde "Bir personele atandı" yerine atanan kişinin ismi. Kök: `CreateTaskCommand` denetim Details'i `"Assigned to user {guid}"` yazıyordu → FormatNote "Bir personele atandı". Artık `"Assigned to: {displayName}"` (target.DisplayName) yazılıyor → FormatNote "Atanan: {isim}". (Mevcut eski kayıtlar guid'li kalır; yeni atamalar ismi gösterir.)
- [x] `#644` — Tamamlanmış taleplerde Ekler/Fotoğraf kilit metni "Talep onaylandığı için..." yerine "Talep tamamlandığı için...". Yeni i18n `attachments.lockedCompletedRequest` (tr/en; mevcut `lockedCompleted` "Görev..." task içindi). JobsPage 3 kilit metni daluna Completed kolu eklendi.
- [x] `#632` — Üst düzey yönetici talebi hedef birime aktifken (Onay Bekleyen incoming) Ekler/Fotoğraf'ta "Talep onaylandığı için..." uyarısı çıkıyordu. Incoming (isRequestDetailContext) bağlamında kilit uyarısı artık yalnızca talep gerçekten kapandığında (Completed/Cancelled/Rejected) gösteriliyor; aktif/onay-bekleyen incoming talepte gösterilmiyor. Giden/Taleplerim bağlamı değişmedi.
- [x] `#640` — Bildirime tıklayınca okunmamış→okundu olmuyordu. Kök: #634'te eklediğim FE koruması (`canMarkRead = !isRead && !isHistorical`) geçmiş satırların tek tek okunmasını engelliyordu. Oysa backend `MarkNotificationReadCommand` audit id'lerini zaten işliyor (imleci o olayın zamanına ilerletir → o olay + daha eskiler okundu). `!isHistorical` koruması kaldırıldı; tıklama artık işliyor (#634 alert davranışı korunur). FE build + lint PASS.
- [x] `#648` — Taleplerim → Bekleyen detay başlığında "Talebi İptal Et"in soluna "Düzenle" butonu eklendi (tüm kullanıcılar, onay öncesi talep; `isMyRequestsView && isPreApprovalStatus`). Gridview'daki Düzenle ile aynı akış: `/requests/new?...&editJobId=`. FE build + lint PASS.
- [~] `#645`/`#647` — ATLANDI (kullanıcı kararı): "başkanlık seviyesi üst düzey yönetici" rol modeli yok (RoleCode yalnızca SystemAdmin/Operator/Manager/Staff/Reporter).
- [x] `#621` (yeni gereksinim) — Sol menüde Vatandaş Talepleri açılır grup olsun, altında "WhatsApp Konuşmaları" → /whatsapp. SidebarNav zaten `type:'group'` destekliyordu; AppShell navItemConfigs'e `children` alanı + reduce'da grup üretimi eklendi; social artık grup (parent /social + child /whatsapp, MessageCircle ikon). Banner altındaki WhatsApp butonu/ikonu önceki turda chip olarak eklenmişti (scope-chips). FE build + lint PASS.
- [x] `#652` — = #634 (okunmamış) + #640 (tıkla→okundu); kod zaten yapıyor (backend build düzeldikten sonra deploy edilebilir). Done'a taşındı.
- [~] `#650` — Detay pop-up'ında "İlgili Talep Detayları" başlığı üstüne border çizgisi (görsel polish). Görsel doğrulama gerektiriyor (app+auth+veri); ATLANDI/ertelendi.
- [x] `#653` — Taleplerim detayında Düzenle butonu artık her zaman görünür (Son Tarihi Geçmiş dahil): onay öncesi talepte aktif, değilse pasif (DisabledActionButton, "Bu kayıtta düzenleme yapılamaz"). #648'i genişletir. FE build + lint PASS.
- [x] `#649` — Taleplerim detay pop-up'ının en altına "Görev Detayları" bölümü eklendi (talebin görev(ler)i varsa): her görev için Görev No (G-yıl-n), Başlık, Atanan, Görev/Son/Tamamlanma Tarihi, Durum — Görevlerim'deki etiketli kutuya benzer. `detail.tasks` (JobDetail) verisinden, frontend-only. `getTaskStatusLabel` import edildi. FE build + lint PASS.
- [x] `#648` (reopened) / `#654` — Taleplerim detayındaki Düzenle butonu artık gridview'daki `canEdit` mantığını birebir yansıtıyor (`isPreApprovalStatus || (isManagerLike && (...))`) → standart olmayan kullanıcılarda da uygun durumlarda aktif; arka plan teal (bg-teal-700, gridview ile aynı), uygun değilse pasif. FE build + lint PASS.
- [x] `#655` — SocialMessagesPage'deki "WhatsApp Yazışmaları" çipi, başında WhatsApp marka ikonu (ChannelIcon) olan "WhatsApp" butonuna çevrildi (yine /whatsapp'a gider). Kullanılmayan MessageCircle importu kaldırıldı. FE build + lint PASS.
- [x] `#642`/`#643` — Görev/Talep Detayları'nda Durum'un yanına parantezde durumu belirleyen kullanıcı + tıklanabilir renkli not. Veri denetim kaydından türetildi (kullanıcı kararı, migration yok): BE `TaskDetailResponse.StatusActorDisplayName` (GetTaskByIdQuery: son TaskCancelled/TaskCompleted audit'in ActorDisplayName); `JobDetailResponse.StatusActorDisplayName`+`CompletionNote` (GetJobByIdQuery: iptal→JobCancelled/JobOwnerRejected actor; tamamlanmış→en son tamamlanan görevin notu+TaskCompleted actor; onay bekleyen→sahip birim yöneticisi). FE: Durum hücreleri JSX'e çevrildi — "(isim)" + kırmızı "İptal Notu" (job: cancelReason / task: revisionReason) ve yeşil "Tamamlama Notu" (job: completionNote / task: notes) → ConfirmDialog pop-up. i18n jobs/tasks.detail.cancelNote/completionNote (tr/en). BE build + 10 test + FE build + lint PASS. Runtime exercise edilmedi (seed yok).
- BE build + FE build + lint PASS.

## Round 65 (#645/#647/#648/#656 — "başkanlık seviyesi" daraltma)
- Kullanıcı netleştirdi: "Üst Düzey Yönetici" = Reporter rolü (UI etiketi), "başkanlık seviyesi" = **Başkanlık birimi**. Yani bu kartlar Reporter + departmentName === 'Başkanlık'.
- Doğrulama (kod): #645 zaten karşılanıyordu (JobsPage:571 reporter görünüm listesi external-pending içermiyor); #647/#648/#656 paralel commit `73aff14` ile uygulanmıştı ama `isReporter` (tüm reporterlar) ile.
- [x] Daraltma: `isPresidencyReporter = isReporter && user?.departmentName === 'Başkanlık'` helper'ı eklendi; grid + detay `canReporterEdit` artık `isPresidencyReporter` kullanıyor → her zaman aktif Düzenle yalnızca Başkanlık birimindeki Üst Düzey Yönetici'lere özel. #645 (external-pending) tüm reporterlar için zaten gizli bırakıldı (Başkanlık'ı kapsar; daraltmak Başkanlık dışı reporterlara yönetici görünümünü geri ekler → regresyon). FE build + lint PASS.

## Round 66 (Doing batch — 6 kart: #646 #633 #610 #638 #585 #637)
- [x] `#646` — Başkanlık seviyesi üst düzey yönetici (Reporter + Başkanlık birimi), Taleplerim → Bekleyen/Yapılmakta Olan/Son Tarihi Geçmiş detayında Ekler/Fotoğraflar bölümünde artık "Talep onaylandığı için... eklenemez" yerine "Dosya ekle" görüyor. JobsPage attachment bloğunda (Location A) `canPresidencyEditAttachments = isPresidencyReporter && isMyRequestsView && view ∈ {pending,in-progress,overdue}` eklendi; `canEditJobAttachments`'a OR'landı → `showAttachmentLockNotice` otomatik gizleniyor, upload kontrolü açılıyor. Backend kontrol: UploadAttachmentCommand/AttachmentsController durum/rol gating yapmıyor (yalnızca tenant + dosya türü/boyut) → UI değişikliği yeterli. FE build + lint PASS. (Runtime exercise edilmedi — seed yok; Başkanlık reporter + onaylı talep gerekiyor.)
- [x] `#638` `#585` — BEST-EFFORT (kullanıcı "push best-effort" dedi). Tarayıcı zoom'u (%80↔%90) reflow'unun kök nedeni: `globals.css`'te içerik genişliği 1024px üstünde tam genişlikti AMA 1680–1919px arası `min(100%,100rem)` (1600px ortalı) ile sınırlıydı, ≥1920'de yine tam genişlik. Yani tarayıcı zoom'u innerWidth'i 1680/1920 sınırlarından geçirince içerik 1600px-ortalı ↔ tam-genişlik arasında sıçrayıp yatay reflow yapıyordu. 1680 width cap'i kaldırıldı (≥1024 her zaman tam genişlik) → sınır geçişinde reflow yok. Canlı prod'da (Claude Chrome, Test Mudur) doğrulama: otomasyon viewport'u 1414px'e kilitli + tarayıcı zoom'u set edilemiyor, bu yüzden tam 1920/%90 durumu reprodüksiyon edilemedi; değişiklik mantıkla hedeflendi. FE build + lint PASS.
- [x] `#610` `#637` — BEST-EFFORT. 15.6"/yüksek zoom'da banner altındaki filtre çipleri (butonlar) banner ile gridview arasında sıkışmış/üstüne binmiş görünüyordu. Canlı prod ölçümü: banner ile çipler arası boşluk ~10px, ama `.sticky-page-header` gölgesi `0 18px 36px` ~50px aşağı taşıyor → çipler banner'ın koyu gölgesinde kalıyor. Düzeltme: gölge `0 6px 16px`'e hafifletildi + `.scope-chips` padding-block 0.2rem→0.45rem (daha fazla nefes payı) + `position:relative`. Canlı prod'a CSS enjekte edilip doğrulandı: çipler/tablo net ayrık, regresyon yok. (Boşluklar zoom ile büyüdüğü için literal "tablo butonların üstüne çıkıyor" reprodüksiyon edilemedi; gerçek neden büyük olasılıkla CSS zoom+sticky render artefaktı — kullanıcı 1920/%90'da doğrulayıp gerekirse yeniden açar.)
- [x] Yan düzeltme (lint gate): `eslint.config.js`'e `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars` için `argsIgnorePattern/varsIgnorePattern/caughtErrorsIgnorePattern: '^_'` eklendi — `_appearance` (no-op `applyTenantBrowserBranding`) gibi bilerek-kullanılmayan `_` önekli adlar artık doğru şekilde yok sayılıyor (config'te bu kural eksikti, `theme.ts:134` lint'i kırıyordu). `useColumnFilters.ts`'teki artık gereksiz `eslint-disable` direktifi kaldırıldı. FE build + lint PASS.
- [x] `#633` — Bildirim rozeti tek tıkla birden çok azalıyordu (9→4). Kök neden: rozet = gerçek okunmamış (Notifications) + geçmiş okunmamış (AuditLog türevli, #634). Geçmiş bildirimler **imleçle** (NotificationReadCursor) okunuyordu; #640'ta tek tıklama imleci o olayın zamanına ilerletiyordu → o olay + **daha eski tüm** olaylar okunmuş sayılıyordu (rozet birden çok düşüyordu). Çözüm: geçmiş bildirimler için **tekil** okuma izi — yeni `NotificationAuditRead (TenantId,UserId,AuditLogId)` entity + migration `AddNotificationAuditRead` (unique index). `MarkNotificationReadCommand` audit kaydında artık imleci ilerletmek yerine tek satır ekliyor (idempotent); `GetUnreadNotificationCountQuery` ve `GetNotificationsQuery` tekil okunanları hariç tutuyor. "Hepsini okundu yap" hâlâ imleci ilerletir (MarkAllNotificationsReadCommand değişmedi). FE: NotificationBell panel açılınca unread-count invalidate edilir (rozet tıklamadan önce güncel olur). BE build + 10 test + FE build + lint PASS. (Runtime exercise edilmedi — seed yok; başka kullanıcının ürettiği audit olayları gerekiyor.)

## Round 67 (Doing batch — 3 kart: #661 #650 #660; canlı prod (Claude Chrome) inceleme)
- [x] `#661` — Tüm sayfalardaki banner üstündeki "← Geri" butonu, banner'ın (`.desktop-page-shell`, padding-inline 1/1.5/2rem) sol başlangıç hizasının solunda kalıyordu çünkü AppShell'de Geri butonu `<main>` içindeki `.desktop-page-shell` kardeşinin sahip olduğu yatay iç boşluğa sahip değildi. Geri sarmalayıcı div'e `px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8` eklendi → banner sol hizasıyla aynı. FE build + lint PASS.
- [x] `#650` — Taleplerim / Birime Gelen / Birimden Giden detay pop-up'ında "Talep Detayları" başlık bölümü, Görev pop-up'undaki "İlgili Talep Detayları" / "Görev Detayları" kutularıyla aynı kart tasarımına getirildi: `mb-5 border-t border-slate-200 pt-3` (yalnızca üst çizgi) → `form-card page-stack mb-5` (tam kenarlıklı kart); başlıktan `mb-2` kaldırıldı (page-stack gap idare ediyor). FE build + lint PASS.
- [x] `#660` — Başkanlık seviyesi üst düzey yönetici (isPresidencyReporter), Taleplerim → "Tüm Taleplerim" (activeJobView==='all') gridview'inde iptal edilemeyen satırlarda görsel bütünlük için pasif "İptal" görür. JobsPage satır eylemlerindeki İptal bloğu IIFE'ye çevrildi: iptal edilebilir durumda aktif `Button` (destructive); değilse + isPresidencyReporter + all görünüm → `DisabledActionButton` (destructive, hoverTitle "Bu kayıt iptal edilemez"); aksi halde null. FE build + lint PASS.
- NOT: Canlı prod inceleme sırasında Chrome eklenti bağlantısı düştü; #661/#650 deterministik CSS/yapı değişikliği, #660 kapsamlı mantık değişikliği — build+lint temiz, deploy sonrası kullanıcı doğrulaması bekleniyor (yanlışsa yeniden açılır).

## Round 68 (Doing batch — #664 #663: gridview Durum sütunu etiket + renk)
- [x] `#664` — "Tüm" gridview'lerinde Durum sütununda "Aktif" (öyle bir statü yok) ve "Yapıldı" görünüyordu. Kök: ham enum etiketleri (`enum.jobStatus.Active`="Aktif", `enum.taskStatus.{Completed,Closed,PendingCloseApproval}`="Yapıldı") — Birime Gelen ve detay pop-up'larında kullanılıyor. (Taleplerim/Görevlerim/Birimdeki/Personelimin "all" hücreleri zaten getJobDisplayStatus/getTaskDisplayStatus kullanıyordu → doğru etiket.) Locale düzeltildi (tr+en): Active→"Yapılmakta Olan"/"In Progress", Completed/Closed/PendingCloseApproval→"Tamamlanmış"/"Completed". Global olduğu için ekran görselindeki Birime Gelen dahil her yerde "Aktif"/"Yapıldı" kalkar. FE build + lint PASS.
- [x] `#663` — Aynı "Tüm" gridview'lerde Durum hücresi arka plan rengi: Tamamlanmış→yeşil, İptal/Reddedildi→kırmızı, Yapılmakta→sarı, Son Tarihi Geçmiş→turuncu, Bekleyen/diğer→nötr (mevcut). localization.ts'e `getJobStatusTone`/`getTaskStatusTone` (getJob/TaskDisplayStatus mantığıyla paralel) + `getStatusPillClass(tone)` eklendi. JobsPage Taleplerim all hücresi (1390) ve TasksPage Görevlerim/Birimdeki/Personelimin all hücresi (1775) `StatusPill tone="neutral"` → `className={getStatusPillClass(...)}`. StatusPill `cn`=twMerge olduğu için renk sınıfları nötr varsayılanı override eder. FE build + lint PASS.
- NOT: Canlı doğrulama deploy sonrası (Chrome bağlantısı dalgalıydı); etiket locale + renk twMerge davranışı kod düzeyinde doğrulandı.

## Round 69 (Doing — #670: Tüm Görevlerim başlık çakışması)
- [x] `#670` — Görevlerim → Tüm Görevlerim'de "Sıra" ile "Bağlı Olduğu Talep No" başlıkları iç içe geçiyordu. Kök: `.my-tasks-all-table` `table-layout:fixed` + başlık hücreleri `white-space:nowrap` (ortalı) → uzun "BAĞLI OLDUĞU TALEP NO" başlığı sabit kolon genişliğine sığmayıp ortadan iki yana taşıyor, dar "Sıra" kolonunun üzerine biniyordu. (Önceki düzeltme ilk kolonu 4.5rem yapmıştı ama başlık taşmasını çözmüyordu.) Çözüm: `.my-tasks-all-table thead th` için `white-space:normal; overflow-wrap:break-word; line-height:1.18` → başlıklar kolon içinde sarılıyor, taşma/çakışma yok. globals.css (1024px bloğu) sadece. FE build + lint PASS. (Canlı doğrulama bekliyor — Chrome bağlantısı kapalı.)

## Round 70 (Doing — #674 #675: Ekrana Yansıt başlık)
- [x] `#674` — Ekrana Yansıt (WallboardPage /display) hero'sunun en sol üst köşesine ana sayfadaki (sidebar) kurum logosu eklendi: `useTenantTheme()` → `appearance.logoUrl`, `<MunicipalitySeal compact src={logoUrl} />` `wallboard-brand`ın başına (fullscreen butonundan önce). FE build + lint PASS.
- [x] `#675` — Ekrana Yansıt'ta saatin soluna takvim ikonu + tarih eklendi: `wallboard-clock` içine `<CalendarDays/>` + `formatClockDate(lastUpdatedAt)` (gg.aa.yyyy), mevcut Clock3+saatin soluna. `formatClockDate` helper'ı eklendi. FE build + lint PASS.

## Round 71 (Doing — #674 #675 yeniden açıldı: Ekrana Yansıt logo/saat düzeltme)
- [x] `#674` (reopened) — Ekrana Yansıt'ta istenen görsel kurum CRESTİ değil, ana sayfa sidebar'ının sol üst köşesindeki **Atatürk** görseliymiş (`/header-ataturk.png`, ek: ataturk_ekranayansit.png). Önceki turda eklediğim `MunicipalitySeal` (tire belediyesi arması) kaldırıldı; yerine AppShell sidebar'daki ile aynı `<img src="/header-ataturk.png" className="h-16 w-auto opacity-80 pointer-events-none">` wallboard-brand başına eklendi. Kullanılmayan MunicipalitySeal/useTenantTheme importları ve logoUrl kaldırıldı.
- [x] `#675` (reopened) — (a) Saat verisine **saniye** eklendi: `formatTime` `{hour,minute,second:'2-digit'}` → ss:dd:ss. (b) Ok ile gösterilen "tire belediyesi" arması zaten #674 kapsamında kaldırıldı (MunicipalitySeal). (Önceki turda eklenen takvim ikonu + tarih korundu.)
- NOT: Canlı doğrulama bekliyor (Chrome bağlantısı kapalı). /header-ataturk.png public/ içinde mevcut. FE build + lint PASS.

## Round 72 (Doing — #674 (3.kez) #676: Ekrana Yansıt köşe hizası + canlı saat)
- [x] `#674` (reopened, köşe hizası) — Atatürk görseli inline (wallboard-brand içinde, sayfa padding'inden içeride) duruyordu; ana sayfadaki gibi en sol en üst köşeye flush hizalandı: `<img>` wallboard-brand'ten çıkarılıp `.wallboard-page`'in doğrudan çocuğu yapıldı, `absolute left-0 top-0 z-10 pointer-events-none`; `.wallboard-page`'e `position: relative` eklendi (globals.css). AppShell sidebar'daki konumlandırmayla aynı.
- [x] `#676` — Saat saniyeleri saymıyordu (lastUpdatedAt = son yenileme anı, sabit). Canlı saat: `now` state + her 1 sn `setInterval(() => setNow(new Date()))`; saat artık `now`'dan tarih+saat(saniyeli) gösteriyor, her saniye ilerliyor. Kullanılmayan `lastUpdatedAt`/`setLastUpdatedAt` kaldırıldı. FE build + lint PASS.
- NOT: Canlı doğrulama bekliyor (Chrome bağlantısı kapalı).

## Round 73 (otonom 30dk döngü — #703: görev detayı onay tarihi etiketleri)
- [x] `#703` — TasksPage "İlgili Talep Detayları" özetinde: cross-department talepte "Talebi Oluşturan Departman'ın Onay Tarihi" → "Talebin Birim Yöneticisinin Onay Tarihi"; altına "Talebi Gerçekleştiren Birim Yöneticisinin Onay Tarihi" (görevin atandığı/hedef birimin `decidedAtUtc`) eklendi (`fulfillingJobDepartment` = `assignedDepartmentId`'e eşleşen JobDepartment). JobsPage'deki Owner/Target ayrımıyla aynı yaklaşım; yeni alan yalnızca cross-department talepte gösterilir. FE build + lint PASS. main+master push, Done.
- NOT: Kullanıcı sahada değilken otonom döngünün ilk kartı; veriye bağlı detay görünümü, seed yok → kod düzeyinde + build/lint doğrulaması.

## Round 74 (otonom 30dk döngü — #704: Birime Gelen onay bekleyen detay durumu)
- [x] `#704` — Birime Gelen → Onay Bekleyen detay pop-up'ında (JobsPage `/request-details`, `context=incoming`), birim-dışı talep sahibi birim onaylayıp iş `Active` olsa bile hedef birim yöneticisi henüz personel atamadıysa (görev yok) Durum "Yapılmakta" görünüyordu. Kök: pop-up etiketi `detail.status === 'Active' ? 'Yapılmakta'`. Bu satırın başına koşul eklendi: `isIncomingRequestDetail && status==='Active' && tasks boş` → "Yönetici Onayı Bekliyor"; yönetici görev atayınca (taskCount>0) "Yapılmakta"ya geçer. Değişiklik yalnızca incoming bağlamına kapsamlı (diğer detay görünümleri/`getJobStatusLabel` etkilenmedi). FE build + lint PASS. main+master push, Done.
- NOT: `isJobPendingTargetApproval` (Active+tasks boş) zaten modellenmiş durumdu; aynı ölçüt etiket için kullanıldı. Veriye bağlı görünüm, seed yok → kod düzeyinde + build/lint doğrulaması.

## Round 75 (otonom 30dk döngü — #705 #706 #708 #709: görev detayı pop-up düzeltmeleri)
Kartların ekran görselleri Trello'dan indirilip incelendi (gerçek UI durumunu netleştirdi).
- [x] `#705` — Görev Detayları özet kartında "Öncelik", orta kolon başından sol kolona "Görev Tipi"nin hemen altına alındı. TasksPage (Görevlerim) + JobsPage (Birime Gelen "Görev Detayları") pop-up'ları card 649 ile birebir aynı tutulduğu için ikisinde de uygulandı; TasksPage sol kolon alt-sınır çizgisi yeni son satır "Öncelik"e taşındı. FE build+lint PASS. main+master, Done.
- [x] `#706` — "Talep Onay Tarihi" → "Talebin Birim Yöneticisinin Onay Tarihi". TasksPage'te #703'le eklenen ternary'nin else dalı sabitlendi (artık birim-içi/dışı fark etmeksizin tek etiket) + JobsPage `requestDetailRows` yazdırma tablosu. İkisi de Owner birim `decidedAtUtc`. FE build+lint PASS. main+master, Done.
- [x] `#708` — Görev detay pop-up'ı "İlgili Talep Detayları"nda "Son Tarih Bilgisi" → "Son Tarih" (TasksPage:1596, ekran görselinde işaretli). Yazdırma tablosundaki aynı etiket kart "pop up'ta" diye kapsamladığı için dokunulmadı. FE build+lint PASS. main+master, Done.
- [x] `#709` — Birime Gelen "Görev Detayları"nda Görev Tipi "Atanmış Ad" → "Atanmış (Ad)" (JobsPage:2072-74, `assignedUserDisplayName` paranteze alındı); Görevlerim pop-up'ındaki (TasksPage:1227, zaten parantezli) formatla eşitlendi. FE build+lint PASS. main+master, Done.
- NOT: #709 önce TasksPage:1227 sanılmıştı (orası zaten parantezli); ekran görseli sayesinde gerçek yerin JobsPage Görev Detayları olduğu görüldü. Veriye bağlı pop-up'lar, seed yok → kod düzeyinde + build/lint + ekran görseli doğrulaması.

## Round 76 (otonom 30dk döngü — #710 #711: tamamlanma/iptal tarihi gösterimi)
Konvansiyon: tamamlanma=`completedAtUtc` ("Tamamlanma Tarihi"), iptal=`updatedAtUtc` ("İptal Tarihi") — kod tabanında zaten böyle (JobsPage/TasksPage rejected/completed görünümleri).
- [x] `#710` — Görev Detayları özet pop-up'ında "Son Tarih"ten önce koşullu satır: Completed → "Tamamlanma Tarihi" (completedAtUtc), Cancelled → "İptal Tarihi" (özet `selectedTask.updatedAtUtc`; TaskDetail'da updatedAtUtc yok). TasksPage (Görevlerim) + JobsPage (Birime Gelen, `detail.tasks`) ikisine de uygulandı (card 649). FE build+lint PASS. main+master, Done.
- [x] `#711` — "Tümü/Tüm" gridview Durum sütununda pill'in altına: Completed→tamamlanma tarihi, Cancelled→iptal tarihi (küçük gri metin, `flex flex-col`). Tek hücre/sayfa ile tüm görünümler: TasksPage `showStatusColumn` (Görevlerim/Birimdeki "Tüm Görevler" + Personelimin "Tüm Personel"), JobsPage all-view (Taleplerim + Birimden Giden "Tümü"), IncomingRequestsPage all-view (Birime Gelen "Tümü"). Ekran görseli (711.png) ile doğrulandı. FE build+lint PASS. main+master, Done.
- NOT: Yalnızca raw `currentStatus`/`status` === Completed/Cancelled koşulu (overdue/rejected'a tarih eklenmez — kart yalnızca tamamlanmış/iptal diyor). Veriye bağlı, seed yok → kod + build/lint + görsel doğrulaması.

## Round 77 (otonom 30dk döngü — #709(reopened) #712 #713: yönetici adı + Son Tarih border)
- [x] `#709` (reopened) — Birime Gelen "Görev Detayları"nda Görev Tipi "Atanmış" görevde görev SAHİBİNİ gösteriyordu (önceki turda `assignedUserDisplayName` paranteze almıştım); kullanıcı ATAYAN YÖNETİCİ adını istedi. **Backend**: `TaskSummaryResponse`'a opsiyonel `AssigningManagerDisplayName` eklendi (3 call-site'tan yalnızca JobQueries dolduruyor; diğerleri default null → değişmedi), JobQueries görev projeksiyonu komşu `AssignedUserDisplayName` subquery deseniyle `t.AssigningManagerId`→DisplayName doldurdu. EF expression-tree pozisyon-dışı isimli argüman kabul etmediği için (CS9307) tüm pozisyonel argümanlar verildi (JobCreatedAtUtc=null, HasPendingExtraTimeRequest=false önceki davranışla aynı). **Frontend**: Task tipine `assigningManagerDisplayName` + JobsPage taskType. dotnet build + FE build/lint PASS. main+master, Done.
- [x] `#712` / `#713` (duplike) — Görev Detayları / İlgili Talep Detayları özet kartlarında orta kolon sol kolondan kısa olunca son satır "Son Tarih"in altında kapanış çizgisi yoktu (713b: Rutin görev Görev Detayları; 712b: İlgili Talep Detayları). `Son Tarih` satırına `border-b` eklendi: TasksPage Görev Detayları orta kolon + İlgili Talep rightFields, JobsPage Görev Detayları orta kolon (card 649). Tek commit; #713'e duplike yorumu düşüldü. FE build+lint PASS. main+master, Done.
- NOT: #709 ilk turda yanlış alan (`assignedUserDisplayName`) kullanılmıştı; ekran görseli (Görev Sahibi=Görev Tipi adı aynı) sayesinde yönetici≠sahibi olduğu görüldü. Backend değişikliği komşu çalışan deseni taklit ettiğinden EF runtime riski düşük; seed yok → build doğrulaması.

## Round 78 (otonom 30dk döngü — #714: tarih pill'in İÇİNE)
- [x] `#714` — #711'de "Tümü/Tüm" gridview Durum sütununda tamamlanma/iptal tarihini pill'in DIŞINDA alt satıra koymuştum; kullanıcı tarihin pill ÇERÇEVESİNİN İÇİNDE (durum metninin altında) olmasını istedi. Üç hücre (TasksPage showStatusColumn, JobsPage all-view, IncomingRequestsPage all-view) IIFE ile `statusDate` (Completed→completedAtUtc, Cancelled→updatedAtUtc) hesaplayıp StatusPill içeriğini `flex flex-col items-center leading-tight` ile iki satıra çıkardı (tarih `text-[0.68rem] opacity-80`). FE build+lint PASS. main+master, Done.
